# Simple Sign In
This app allows a user to add a name and email to mysql database.
Then the user can sign in and authenticate their email.

The php files are also included in this repository.

The database is private, but all you need to know is that
the Users Table has three attributes:
  -uid
  -uname
  -uemail


The two scripts that handle user authentication and registration are included.
They are aptly titled:
  -authentication.php
  -registration.php
